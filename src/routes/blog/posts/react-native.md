## What is React Native?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;React Native allows you to build native mobile apps without using native code. How is this possible? React Native can do this because it compiles the code to the native language of both Android and IOS devices, Java/C++ for Android and Swift for IOS. This means React Native is cross-platform, write your code once and run on any IOS or Android device. You write your app in JavaScript and React code that is very similar to the React code you would write for a web application. The big differences come inside the components, we use native components instead of web components in React Native. You do not render HTML and CSS does not exist in app development. React Native provides a StyleSheet JavaScript object to emulate CSS to native code.

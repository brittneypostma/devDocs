User experience and user interface are two of the key components that make up the total flow and design of a project, but so much more go into creating a great design. Having a solid foundation in graphic design, goal conversion, and platform development can give you an edge to be a top designer. Before I get into more detail on some of the advanced topics, we are going to start with the basics and build that foundation we need to be great designers.

### Resources

- [Figma](https://www.figma.com/downloads/)

The main program used throughout the course, is Figma. Figma is a free design and prototyping tool that makes it easy to collaborate on projects. It is primarily web-based, but has an app that can be downloaded on mac and Windows. Below you can find the full list of resources for the course.

## Fidelity in Design

[Understanding Design Fidelity for Creating a Great Product Experience](https://cantina.co/understanding-design-fidelity-for-creating-a-great-product-experience/)

Fidelity is a word that in design refers to the amount of detail and functionality in the design process. There are three levels: low, mid, and high fidelity. Low is going to be our sketches and user flows, then move into mid for wireframes, and finally, high fidelity for the prototypes of our product. Getting the low-to-mid range fidelity right, can build up a strong and effective base for your product. It allows the design to develop and change as each process is tested. By not focusing on the visual aspects of the site, the users can focus on the functional aspects in your product.

## Sketching

Sketching is the first part of the design process. It is where you generate as many ideas as you can quickly and get them down on paper. Details are not important at this stage. After gathering your **ideas** together, you can then decide which is the best and most efficient strategy to work with. Next, you will need to sketch out your ideas into **wireframes**. In this step you will add details, refine the design, and cut out things that don't work. Finally, you will want to pull out the elements of the design that are the most important or repeated throughout the design. These **components** will really help when building the project.

### Sketching Process

Every process in design has multiple steps you should take to create a successful work environment. Step one is **be prepared**! Gather any tools you may need before you start working. These tools could be rulers, markers, pens or pencils, or even a tablet. This way you don't forget a great idea because you didn't have a tool you needed to create it. Step two is to understand your **goals** and what **audience** you will need to reach with this design. Step three, always **time yourself**. Keeping yourself within a time limit helps you to focus your time and energy on the things that matter most and not get bogged down by the details while sketching. Step four is to create a **frame** for your design. Something like a mobile screen for an app or a desktop frame for a website, anything that will help you guide the placement of your design. Start with the simple, repeating elements and then fill in more and more details and interactions. Step five, **annotate**, **document**, and make **notes** on your sketches. Once you are ready, **share your sketches** with anyone that will listen. Everyone has valuable insight and feedback about the flow of the design that you can build off of and modify with. Step 6, the final step, is to **refine** your sketches. Add titles to your sketches and add more notes about elements that may be too hard to draw. Also, numbering and adding arrows to your sketches can help to label and add a visual flow that will help others give better feedback. Gestures such as pressing or swiping can be added to those sketches that reflect an action. These can be hard to draw, but using arrows for swiping or dragging and circles for tapping can be enough to get the point across.

### Sketching User Flows

To start creating your first sketch, you should first understand what you need to draw. Ask yourself, what part of the project do you want to start with and decide where you want to begin. It doesn't matter what you choose, but having a clear understanding of where you want to start will help formulate your ideas. Then, you want to decide where you want to lead the users and what they need to do to get there. As you are sketching, continue asking yourself what would happen if a user clicked here or what do I want this thing to do. Think about this as the users **journey** through the product, from the time they enter, to the time they leave. Always be on the lookout for **user misery** pain-points and ways you can improve their experience.

### Sketching Screen Flows

After building out your first draft, start breaking down each page and thinking about what flow will happen from it. Say you have a search bar that when a user searches, does the user need to click search or will it automatically search for results? Once the user clicks on a product, think of where the button might be to add it to the cart. In the cart, there may be another button to go to checkout. Start pulling out these similar elements and noticing where they are placed. These become your components and the groupings are where you could place your navigation or activities. Also, always think about more than one way a user could flow through the product. In this example, a categories page could be another way a user finds the item, rather than searching. 

### Structure

Now we need to start thinking about the navigation patterns or the **structure** flow of the product. In our example, we determined there was a **home screen** that the users would land on. Try sketching it out with more details this time and then add a home button to the navigation bar. We also created a search page that should be on the navigation bar. One thing we didn't add yet, is a way for the users to save the products that they liked. Maybe we can add a **favorites** page and add a heart button to the navigation. We also want the **cart** page to be a prominent feature so that users can find their way to checkout and purchase items. Especially on mobile, make sure its easy for the users to checkout. Maybe we can switch our navigation bar to be the checkout button and make a way to go back at the top of the page. Another thing we might need is a way for users to track their orders. After the structure is determined, we can start building out a **site map**, a listing of the main pages and all the branch pages that can be accessed from it.

</p>
<br/>

### States

At this point we have the general flow of the entire product down, but we haven't really focused on the individual pages yet. Here is when we should start thinking about the **states**, **or actions**, that might happen on each page. Take the home page, how does the search bar appear, is there a profile image, maybe a heart to favorite an item. This is where we really start to add the details to the page.

### Tips for Sketching

- &#x25FE; Don't worry about being messy.
- &#x25FE; The more you practice, the easier it is. Use building blocks.
- &#x25FE; Keep the sketches safe, especially paper ones. Scan or take a picture and store in a folder.
- &#x25FE; Always be prepared. Keep something near you to jot down ideas as much as possible.
- &#x25FE; Communicate and share your sketches.

## Inspiration

Seeing a great design can create some momentary inspiration, but it doesn't always last. Creativity is like a muscle, use it or it gets weaker. **"You need to constantly stimulate your creativity." - Daniel Schifano** Talking to your peers and people you work with can spark ideas and help figure out design challenges. Study how other designers work and get to their solutions. Start a collection of great techniques to build your projects off of. Keep inspiration around you by surrounding yourself with great design. Your desk and computer screen can help or hurt your work flow depending on how you have it set up, make it work best for you. Read a variety of topics to keep educated in your field. Knowing about other areas can sometimes help you to approach a problem in a different light. If designing is your job, take time to design for yourself too. As much as you can, try to immerse yourself in other cultures. Whether by traveling or inside your community, finding ways to meet new people can always help expand your design inspiration. Sometimes just taking a walk can help as well.

## User Flows

A user flow is the steps a user takes to achieve a goal. A sketch of user flows is intended to communicate the steps the user takes through different pages and actions. They should include a name, step number, and type of user for each flow. The current flow you are on is what the user sees and does and then after is what they see and do next. User flows go in **one** direction, they don't go backwards, that is [prototyping](#prototypes). Name each flow and label each screen descriptively based on its purpose.

> ### Test Early, Test Often

---

## Sitemaps

Sitemaps provide the structure for your product, they are especially useful for designers. They can help you plan out all the different navigation patterns in your product. So what is a sitemap? Sitemaps are diagrams in a specific order that show how pages are organized. Sitemaps should be created pretty early in the design process, to get a better understanding of components that are needed to build up the product.

### Creating a Sitemap

A sitemap will consists of all the pages a site will have. Start with the **anatomy** of your product and list out all the individual pages. Once you have a list, we can start creating the sitemap. Start with the home page at the top. Each piece of the sitemap should have a **label** of the page it's about and a **reference number** for what step in the process it is. Color coding or creating a **legend** for your map may be useful if it particularly difficult to describe something on the map. It really is your preference on how you want to lay out the sitemap, left to right or top to bottom, anything works. **Flat Sitemaps** are for smaller sites because there are fewer levels to the map. **Deep Sitemaps** would be for a site with hundreds of pages where they go greater than 3 levels deep. Sitemaps are a valuable step because it helps strategically place content where users can find it and aids in the navigation of your product. Use the sketches and user flows you created to help you build out your sitemap.

## Wireframes

Wireframes provide a **blueprint** to our product by detailing information that is displayed on each page, providing an outline and structure to the product, and describing the direction and message of your product. It is a way to use everything you've created up to this point to really start putting the site together. Wireframes will help you better understand how users will navigate through your product and make sure their are efficient pathways. Build off of them and learn from the feedback you get to better the product. Failing can be good if you learn from the mistakes and fix the problems. If you are working on a team, wireframes can help everyone get on the same page with the layout. Even if you aren't on a team, get users to test your product. This always uncovers pain points and places where you can improve the user experience of your product. Wireframes are also a great way to get feedback from clients. The earlier you can find and fix issues, the easier it will be once we get to the final product. Remember to keep it simple, more detailed than the sketch, but not the final design. Start with pencil and paper and then move your sketches to a program like Figma to allow for easier sharing. If you are sharing with a client, add a little more polish to the product to make it look presentable and make sure to explain that this is to showcase the interactions, not the visual design of the product.

## Feedback

Getting feedback throughout the design process is a great way to help see issues, but it may not always feel easy to get feedback or nice to get critiqued. However, finding the issues earlier in the process can make the whole project be more efficient and better in the long run. There are two types of feedback that can impact your design, **constructive** and **destructive**. Constructive feedback can still be positive or negative, but will still aid in the design process. Destructive feedback impedes the design moving forward. It is mostly caused by asking users the wrong questions or misleading them. Clients can even get off on a topic that is not relevant to the current stage of the design process. You need to be the one that gets others to give constructive feedback. Be as clear as possible when explaining the context of what you want feedback on. You can send a message ahead of time to inform them of what you need. Another thing you can do is set goals that you want to accomplish at each stage. Break down which aspects need to be focused on and what questions need to be answered. Make sure to explain what stage of the design process you are in so that they know what to expect. In a meeting format, it can be overwhelming to have too many people giving feedback at one time. Only invite the people you need to, think about who would have the answers to your questions. Try to get the group involved by generating, voting, and then discussing all of the ideas. Make sure to stay focused and keep on track. If good feedback is off topic, remember to bookmark it for a later time.

## Grids

[History of the Golden Ratio](https://www.goldennumber.net/golden-ratio-history/)

A grid is a structure that divides a page into a series of rows and columns. But the history behind them is so much more than that. The **golden ratio** is a mathematical equation that can be traced back in design as far as the Egyptian pyramids. The mathematical calculation states, if the ratio of 2 sides is the same as the ratio of the sum of the 2 largest numbers. It is approximately `1.618`.  In the beginning, grids were always linked to print or typography. However, in the Renaissance period artists started using grids with the golden ratio to add balance to artworks, sculptures, and architecture. With newspapers came even more grids to align columns, so they could fit more content while still allowing natural reading behavior. Our modern grid started emerging after WWI in Europe, it was further developed in Switzerland during the 1950s to become the **International Typographic Style** or **Swiss Style**. Some key components of Swiss Style are grids, sans-serif typeface, and the use of white space.

<img src="uiux/ratio.png" alt="the golden ratio calculation" style="width: 50%; min-width: 300px;">
</p>

### Grid Basics

Always start with the basics. In this case, **base units**. The base units are going to define what every other unit is based off of. They make the whole design easier to scale and handoff. The base unit that is the most recommended is **`8px`** because most screen sizes are divisible by 8 and its divisible itself. All other UI elements should be in increments of the base unit. Grids are made up of 3 pieces, columns, gutters, and margins. **Columns** are the vertical sections that go from left to right. **Gutters** are the white space between the columns. **Margins** are the outside edges of the columns that separate the grid from the edge of the screen. The gutter and margin size are going to be a multiple of the base unit. Here are a few different types of grids.
<br/><br/>

- &#x25FE; Manuscript Grid - Used for defining margins and large blocks of text.
- &#x25FE; Column Grid - The grid most used in web design, columns spaced evenly across a page.
- &#x25FE; Modular Grid - This grid has both vertical columns and horizontal rows covering a page.
- &#x25FE; Baseline Grid - Horizontal rows going top to bottom across a page, similar to a notebook you write in.


### Responsive Grids and Breakpoints

Using multiple types of grids together can help balance and visually enhance your design, but once you get your grids on a page, there are still more choices to make. The responsive part of the grid comes with choosing between fixed, fluid, and adaptive grids. **Fixed** layouts will stay the same no matter what the screen size. **Fluid** layouts will stretch and shrink with your content. **Adaptive** layouts will change to use different grids depending on the screen size it is at. By using breakpoints, you are able to change the design of the page for different screen sizes. There are far too many screen sizes out there now to worry about specific breakpoint numbers. Using just small (600px), medium (768px), large (1024px), and extra-large (1280px) sizes will be a good starting off point to get an idea of what the layouts should be.

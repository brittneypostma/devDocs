## Graphic Design: UI and UX

User experience and user interface are two of the key components that make up the total flow and design of a project, but so much more go into creating a great design. Having a solid foundation in graphic design, goal conversion, and platform development can give you an edge to be a top designer. Before I get into more detail on some of the advanced topics, we are going to start with the basics and build that foundation we need to be great designers.

## Sketching

Sketching is the first part of the design process. It is where you generate as many ideas as you can quickly and get them down on paper. Details are not important at this stage. After gathering your **ideas** together, you can then decide which is the best and most efficient strategy to work with. Next, you will need to sketch out your ideas into **wireframes**. In this step you will add details, refine the design, and cut out things that don't work. Finally, you will want to pull out the elements of the design that are the most important or repeated throughout the design. These **components** will really help when building the project.

### Sketching Process

Every process in design has multiple steps you should take to create a successful work environment. Step one is **be prepared**! Gather any tools you may need before you start working. These tools could be rulers, markers, pens or pencils, or even a tablet. This way you don't forget a great idea because you didn't have a tool you needed to create it. Step two is to understand your **goals** and what **audience** you will need to reach with this design. Step three, always **time yourself**. Keeping yourself within a time limit helps you to focus your time and energy on the things that matter most and not get bogged down by the details while sketching. Step four is to create a **frame** for your design. Something like a mobile screen for an app, or a desktop frame for a website, anything that will help you guide the placement of your design. Start with the simple, repeating elements and then fill in more and more details and interactions. Step five, **annotate**, **document**, and make **notes** on your sketches. Once you are ready, **share your sketches** with anyone that will listen. Everyone has valuable insight and feedback about the flow of the design that you can build off of and modify with. Step 6, the final step, is to **refine** your sketches. Add titles to your sketches and add more notes about elements that may be too hard to draw. Also, numbering and adding arrows to your sketches can help to label and add a visual flow that will help others give better feedback. Gestures such as pressing or swiping can be added to those sketches that reflect an action. These can be hard to draw, but using arrows for swiping or dragging and circles for tapping can be enough to get the point across.

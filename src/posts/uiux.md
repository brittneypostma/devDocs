## Graphic Design: UI and UX

User experience and user interface are two of the key components that make up the total flow and design of a project, but so much more go into creating a great design. Having a solid foundation in graphic design, goal conversion, and platform development can give you an edge to be a top designer. Before I get into more detail on some of the advanced topics, we are going to start with the basics and build that foundation we need to be great designers.

## Sketching

Sketching is the first part of the design process. It is where you generate as many ideas as you can quickly and get them down on paper. Details are not important at this stage. After gathering your **ideas** together, you can then decide which is the best and most efficient strategy to work with. Next, you will need to sketch out your ideas into **wireframes**. In this step you will add details, refine the design, and cut out things that don't work. Finally, you will want to pull out the elements of the design that are the most important or repeated throughout the design. These **components** will really help when building the project.

### Sketching Process

Every process in design has multiple steps you should take to create a successful work environment. Step one is **be prepared**! Gather any tools you may need before you start working. These tools could be rulers, markers, pens or pencils, or even a tablet. This way you don't forget a great idea because you didn't have a tool you needed to create it. Step two is to understand your **goals** and what **audience** you will need to reach with this design. Step three, always **time yourself**. Keeping yourself within a time limit helps you to focus your time and energy on the things that matter most and not get bogged down by the details while sketching. Step four is to create a **frame** for your design. Something like a mobile screen for an app or a desktop frame for a website, anything that will help you guide the placement of your design. Start with the simple, repeating elements and then fill in more and more details and interactions. Step five, **annotate**, **document**, and make **notes** on your sketches. Once you are ready, **share your sketches** with anyone that will listen. Everyone has valuable insight and feedback about the flow of the design that you can build off of and modify with. Step 6, the final step, is to **refine** your sketches. Add titles to your sketches and add more notes about elements that may be too hard to draw. Also, numbering and adding arrows to your sketches can help to label and add a visual flow that will help others give better feedback. Gestures such as pressing or swiping can be added to those sketches that reflect an action. These can be hard to draw, but using arrows for swiping or dragging and circles for tapping can be enough to get the point across.

### Sketching User Flows

To start creating your first sketch, you should first understand what you need to draw. Ask yourself, what part of the project do you want to start with and decide where you want to begin. It doesn't matter what you choose, but having a clear understanding of where you want to start will help formulate your ideas. Then, you want to decide where you want to lead the users and what they need to do to get there. As you are sketching, continue asking yourself what would happen if a user clicked here or what do I want this thing to do. Think about this as the users **journey** through the product, from the time they enter, to the time they leave. Always be on the lookout for **user misery** pain-points and ways you can improve their experience.

### Sketching Screen Flows

After building out your first draft, start breaking down each page and thinking about what flow will happen from it. Say you have a search bar that when a user searches, does the user need to click search or will it automatically search for results? Once the user clicks on a product, think of where the button might be to add it to the cart. In the cart, there may be another button to go to checkout. Start pulling out these similar elements and noticing where they are placed. These become your components and the groupings are where you could place your navigation or activities. Also, always think about more than one way a user could flow through the product. In this example, a categories page could be another way a user finds the item, rather than searching. 

### Structure

Now we need to start thinking about the navigation patterns or the **structure** flow of the product. In our example, we determined there was a **home screen** that the users would land on. Try sketching it out with more details this time and then add a home button to the navigation bar. We also created a search page that should be on the navigation bar. One thing we didn't add yet, is a way for the users to save the products that they liked. Maybe we can add a **favorites** page and add a heart button to the navigation. We also want the **cart** page to be a prominent feature so that users can find their way to checkout and purchase items. Especially on mobile, make sure its easy for the users to checkout. Maybe we can switch our navigation bar to be the checkout button and make a way to go back at the top of the page. Another thing we might need is a way for users to track their orders. After the structure is determined, we can start building out a **site map**, a listing of the main pages and all the branch pages that can be accessed from it.

<br/>

### States

At this point we have the general flow of the entire product down, but we haven't really focused on the individual pages yet. Here is when we should start thinking about the **states**, **or actions**, that might happen on each page. Take the home page, how does the search bar appear, is there a profile image, maybe a heart to favorite an item. This is where we really start to add the details to the page.

### Tips for Sketching

- &#x25FE; Don't worry about being messy.
- &#x25FE; The more you practice, the easier it is. Use building blocks.
- &#x25FE; Keep the sketches safe, especially paper ones. Scan or take a picture and store in a folder.
- &#x25FE; Always be prepared. Keep something near you to jot down ideas as much as possible.
- &#x25FE; Communicate and share your sketches.

## Inspiration

Seeing a great design can create some momentary inspiration, but it doesn't always last. Creativity is like a muscle, use it or it gets weaker. **"You need to constantly stimulate your creativity." - Daniel Schifano** Talking to your peers and people you work with can spark ideas and help figure out design challenges. Study how other designers work and get to their solutions. Start a collection of great techniques to build your projects off of. Keep inspiration around you by surrounding yourself with great design. Your desk and computer screen can help or hurt your work flow depending on how you have it set up, make it work best for you. Read a variety of topics to keep educated in your field. Knowing about other areas can sometimes help you to approach a problem in a different light. If designing is your job, take time to design for yourself too. As much as you can, try to immerse yourself in other cultures. Whether by traveling or inside your community, finding ways to meet new people can always help expand your design inspiration. Sometimes just taking a walk can help as well.

## User Flows

A user flow is the steps a user takes to achieve a goal. A sketch of user flows is intended to communicate the steps the user takes through different pages and actions. They should include a name, step number, and type of user for each flow. The current flow you are on is what the user sees and does and then after is what they see and do next. User flows go in **one** direction, they don't go backwards, that is [prototyping](#prototypes). Name each flow and label each screen descriptively based on its purpose.

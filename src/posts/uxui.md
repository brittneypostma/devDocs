## What is UX/UI?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;User experience and user interface are what UX and UI stand for, but what does that really mean? They are both principles that when applied to design can increase the usability and success of your product or application. User experience refers to the users interaction with your application, how does the users interaction with the application make them feel. User interface, on the other hand, is the look and feel of the application. How it is presented to the user, the typography, layout, and design. There are many pieces to both of these, but they are both crucial parts of the process and work in conjunctions with one another.

## What is GraphQL?

GraphQL or GQL stands for Graph Query Language. It is a language built by Facebook to create and query APIs in a strongly typed, what you ask for is what you get way. The alternative is REST, Representation State Transfer, which has been used for a long time to build APIs. REST is very popular, but comes with some disadvantages. 

- 1\. Many endpoints.
- 2\. Hard to visualize data.
- 3\. Over or under fetching data.

GraphQL was created to combat these issues. It is open-source, so anyone can contribute, but it is maintained by Facebook still. GraphQL does a few things better than REST APIs.

- 1\. Only get the data you need. No over-fetching.
- 2\. 1 endpoint, instead of many.
- 3\. Strongly-typed, to validate data.

Rest APIs:
too many endpoints
over and under fetching data

created by facebook
open source
no install
implementations of it from different companies

no long endpoints - single endpoint
no over fetching data you won't use
less round trips to server
read through cache - loaders

graphiql
schema
types - custom objects that represent how the API looks

queries - get data
mutations -  modify data/CUD of CRUD in restful apis
subscriptions - real-time connection to server

Ask for what you want
Get predictable results

Declare what you want, get only what you need

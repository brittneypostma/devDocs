## Build a VSCode Theme

Themes and extensions are a great part of what makes [Visual Studio Code (VSCode)](https://code.visualstudio.com/) so amazing to use. I love changing my colors ever so often, just to get a new look and feel when I code. Creating your own VSCode theme can be a learning and sometimes challenging experience, so I wanted to write this post on my journey in creating my first theme. From editing a theme to publishing on the marketplace, I want to take you step by step through the process. Let's get started!

### Create Files

<br/>
To begin, we need to create a directory to hold our theme files.

<br/>

```bash
mkdir theme-name
cd theme-name
```

There are only 2 required components of a color theme in VSCode, a `package.json` file and a theme file in `json` format. A `readme` file and a logo is always a nice addition, so we will be creating those as well. Let's create the required files. Run `npm init -y` in the directory you made to create the `package.json`. Create a folder called themes or run `mkdir themes` in the terminal. The next step caused me a lot of trouble when first publishing my theme. It is not documented, but the `json` file for the theme, needs to be named a specific way in order for it to show up within the vscode preferences. Inside of your themes folder, create a file named the displayName of your theme followed by `-color-theme.json`. It should look like this if your name is Test Theme, its `Test Theme-color-theme.json`. Here are the commands in order.

```bash
npm init -y
mkdir themes
touch themes/Test Theme-color.theme.json
```

---

### Package.json

For our `package.json` file, there are some required fields for the VSCode extension. After running the `npm init -y`, we should have a file that looks similar to the one below.

<p align="center">

</p>

We can rip out the scripts section and the other fields can be modified to fit your theme. There are additional fields needed for the VSCode extension inside the `package.json` file, these are `publisher`, `engines`, `categories`, and `contributes`, a `displayName` field is also nice. After editing the initial `package.json`, let's add the required fields in.

```js
{
  "publisher": "bDesigned",
  "engines": {
    "vscode": "^1.0.0"
  },
  "categories": [
    "Themes"
  ],
  "contributes": {
    "themes": [
      {
        "label": "test-theme",
        "uiTheme": "vs-dark",
        "path": "./themes/theme-name.json"
      }
    ]
  },
  "displayName": "Theme Name"
```

---

### Edit Colors

Now, we can start working on our theme. VSCode uses a `settings.json` file to edit your workspace. To see the colors as you add them, I edited my  `settings.json` and then added to my `theme/theme-name.json` to ensure they were the correct colors. In VSCode, open `settings.json` by clicking `CTRL+SHIFT+P` in Windows, or `CMD+SHIFT+P` in Mac and then type `settings.json` in the box that pops up. This will open the file.

<br/>

You may already have things inside your `settings.json`, but the areas we need to edit are under `"workbench.colorCustomizations"` and `"editor.tokenColorCustomizations": {"textMateRules":[]}`. To ease the confusion of adding these **scopes**, VSCodes term for the rules used, I created a color pallette and then added a "name" field to all of my `"textMateRules"` that says the color or what the rule is setting. Below is a sample of my `settings.json`.

```js
"workbench.colorCustomizations": {
    "activityBar.background": "#08131a",
    "activityBar.border": "#008c9644",
    "activityBar.foreground": "#008c96",
    "activityBarBadge.background": "#08131a",
    "activityBarBadge.foreground": "#008c96"
},
"editor.tokenColorCustomizations": {
    "textMateRules": [
      {
        "name": "Italic",
        "scope": [
          "comment",
        ],
        "settings": {
          "fontStyle": "italic"
        }
      },
      {
        "name": "Gray",
        "scope": ["comment"],
        "settings": {
          "foreground": "#4b6869"
        }
      },
    ]
}
```

I separated the italic and the colors into individual scopes to keep them apart in case I want to change or remove something, I only need to go to that place. After, figuring out a color pallette, you can add a **scope** with a `"name"` field for each color. To add rules to each of these scopes, we need to figure out what VSCode calls what we want to color. I used the built in **Developer: Inspect Editor Tokens and Scopes** to figure out what each individual item was called. You can find it with the Command Pallette again by searching for the **developer inspect editor** and it should come up with a box that looks similar to the ones below.

<p align="center">
  <img src="vscode-theme/search.png" alt="Command pallette in VSCode" width="50%">
</p>
<p align="center">
  <img src="vscode-theme/inspect.png" alt="inspect editor in VSCode" width="50%">
</p>

On the left side of the bottom image, you can see textmate scopes and on the right are the scopes that fit the currently selected item. The image has the **function** in JavaScript selected. You will use those scopes to add to a color inside your `settings.json`. Usually these are very specific to the language, but just using the base should work in most cases. Here is an example:

```js
"editor.tokenColorCustomizations": {
    "textMateRules": [
      {
        "name": "Dark Teal",
        "scope": [
          "storage.type"
        ],
        "settings": {
          "foreground": "#01779b"
        }
      }
    ]
}
```

Now you can go through each thing you want to colorize and add a scope for that item to the correct color. Once it is where you like it, we can copy the rules over into our `theme.json` file. Everything inside `"workbench.colorCustomizations": { ...copyEverythingHere }` and inside `"textMateRules": [ ...copyEverythingHere ]` needs to be copied over to the `theme.json` file like this:

```js
{
  "name": "Deep Water",
  "type": "dark",
  "colors": {
    ...pasteAll workbench.colorCustomizations here
  },
  "tokenColors": [
      ... pasteAll textMateRules here
  ]
}
```

### Images

After this is done, the theme is technically ready to publish. But, if you want it to look nice, you can add an icon and a readme file. Create an `images` folder in the root directory or `mkdir images` in the terminal. Create an icon and any screenshots in `png` format (SVGs are not supported) and place them in the images folder. We need to update the `package.json` to accept the icon. Add an `"icon"` key followed by the image path `"icon": "images/logo.png"`.

---

### Readme

Now we can add a `readme.md` file to the root directory. Write up info about your theme and add any screenshots of your theme to make it stand out. You can also add some badges to it for some flair from [Badgen.net](https://badgen.net/). Making sure to specify the language the themes support and screenshots showing the theme off are always helpful.

### Becoming a Publisher

[VSCode Docs](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/working-with-extensions/publishing-extension)<br/><br/>

To publish a file in the marketplace, you need to have an access token from Azure. You can create this account by going to [dev.azure.com/vscode](https://dev.azure.com/vscode). Once it is created, we need to get a personal access token. This is a detailed process to get right, so make sure to follow all the directions in the images below. Things to note, in **Organization**, make sure to select **All accessible organizations**. Then, to open the Marketplace option, click on **Custom defined** and **show all scopes**. You can then find the **Marketplace** and click all the check boxes (**read**, **acquire**, **publish**, and **manage**). Once all of this is done, click **Create** and make sure to **save your access token** somewhere as Azure does not save it on their end. Also, copy the access token to the clipboard, because we will use it in the next step.

</p>

### Publish Theme

 Now that we have an Azure account set up to publish on the Marketplace, we can install the `vsce` package and create a publisher. If you already have a publisher name under the account section of [VSCode Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/), you can skip the creation part and use the name you have already created.

```bash
npm i -g vsce
vsce create-publisher your-name 
```

Here it should prompt you for the access token you copied when creating your account. You can use `CTRL+V` on Windows or `CMD+V` on Mac to paste the token. After the publisher is set, we should then be able to login.

```bash
vsce login your-publisher-name
```

In the `package.json` file the `publisher` field is the username used in the vsce login as well. Double check you have copied all of your `settings.json` rules into the correct sections of your themes `json` file and we can move onto packaging and publishing the extension.

```bash
vsce package
vsce publish
```

As long as there were no errors, you should now have a package published in the Marketplace. It will show you a link to the themes page that will take approximately 5 minutes to work. But wait, what if we try to update? VSCode does not automatically track the repo for changes. 

### Updating

If you make any changes to your theme, to update we first need to up our version number in the `package.json` from `1.0.0` to `1.0.1`. After updating the version, push the changes to GitHub.

```bash
git add .
git commit -m 'commit message'
git push
```

When the changes are pushed, we need to **tag** the version with git.

```bash
git tag v1.0.1
```

Once the version is tagged, we can then republish the updated extensions.

```bash
vsce publish
```

Now you should have a fully functional theme on the Marketplace! Hopefully you enjoyed reading through and learned a thing or two along the way!
